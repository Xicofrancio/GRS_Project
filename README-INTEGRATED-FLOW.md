# Integrated Flow: Web App, MinIO, and Bacula

This document explains how your project would work when the web full stack app, MinIO, and Bacula are all fully integrated.

---

## 1. Web App Usage
- Users interact with the Node.js/Express web app.
- The app stores user data in PostgreSQL and files (such as uploads) in MinIO object storage.
- Example: A user uploads a file via the web app, which is saved to a MinIO bucket.

---

## 2. Data Storage
- **Database:** Application data (users, posts, etc.) is stored in PostgreSQL.
- **Object Storage (MinIO):** Large files, images, or backups are stored as objects in MinIO buckets.
- The web app communicates with MinIO using S3-compatible APIs.

---

## 3. Bacula Backup
- Bacula is configured to back up:
  - The web app’s important directories (e.g., user uploads, configs)
  - The PostgreSQL database (by dumping it to a file or using plugins)
  - The MinIO data directory (the underlying files that make up the object storage)
- Bacula jobs run on a schedule or on demand, copying this data to a safe backup location (e.g., `/mnt/bacula`).

---

## 4. Restore Flow
- If data is lost or corrupted (in the app, database, or MinIO), Bacula can restore:
  - The database (by restoring a dump and re-importing it)
  - The MinIO data (by restoring the object storage files)
  - The web app’s files (by restoring the relevant directories)
- After restore, the web app and MinIO are back to their previous state, and users can access their data as before.

---

## 5. Dashboard & Monitoring
- **Baculum Web UI:** Monitor backup jobs, schedule new ones, and perform restores.
- **MinIO Dashboard:** View and manage object storage buckets and files.
- **Web App Admin Panel:** (Optional) Manage users and data.

---

## 6. Example User Story
1. User uploads a file via the web app.
2. The file is stored in MinIO.
3. Bacula, on schedule, backs up the MinIO data and the database.
4. Disaster happens: MinIO data is lost.
5. Bacula restores the MinIO data.
6. User’s file is available again via the web app.

---

## Summary
With full integration, your stack provides a robust, production-like environment where user data, files, and object storage are all protected by automated, restorable backups—ensuring business continuity and data safety.
